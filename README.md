# Visual Analysis of School Shootings in the United States
## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive visual analysis of school shootings in the United States from 1999 to 2023, utilizing an extensive dataset compiled by The Washington Post. The primary goal is to uncover patterns and trends in the timing, geographical distribution, and profiles of the perpetrators.

## Key Findings
- Increase in Frequency: There has been a notable increase in school shootings, particularly after 2012, with significant spikes in 2018 and 2022.
- Geographical and Temporal Patterns: Incidents are more frequent in urban settings like Los Angeles and Chicago and tend to occur mostly in the spring months (March, April, and May).
- Perpetrator Demographics: The typical profile of a perpetrator is a 19-year-old white male, predominantly involved in targeted attacks.
## Research Questions
This study aims to address the following:

- Has the frequency of school shootings increased in recent years?
- What are the common times for these incidents to occur?
- Which states and cities are most affected?
- What are the common characteristics of the perpetrators?
## Methodology
- Data Analysis: Employing Python and Tableau, this project applies advanced computational methods and visual analytics to analyze the data.
- Visualization: Various forms of visual representations like heat maps, line charts, and bar graphs are utilized to illustrate the data effectively.
## Data
The dataset includes 389 incidents with detailed information on each event, including date, location, casualty details, and perpetrator demographics. The data is publicly available and continually updated on GitHub by The Washington Post.
